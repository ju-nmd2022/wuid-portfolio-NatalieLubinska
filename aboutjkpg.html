        <h2>What you can do in Jönköping</h2>
        <p>
          The student life in Jönköping is great. The univerity is located right
          in the center close to all the restaurants, clubs and other
          activities. Often you have walking distance home or to your friends
          from uni. Comparing to my hometown Stockholm, studentlife is alot
          richer because of the walking distance. Jönköping University has alot
          of associations that offer different activities. You can easily find
          an association that suits you, like the sports association, spring
          association or one of the sexmasterys.

    <h2>Nightlife and restaurants</h2>
    <p>
      The nightlife for students consists mostly of Akademin, the studentclub
      open on wednesdays. Shooters is a popular sportsbar for students where you
      can play biliard or shuffleboard. On special occations, like the infamous
      "tentafest", students arrange events at regular clubs like Glädje. In the
      summer the restaurant and club Twin City is popular because of the cozy
      outdoor seating. Honestly I do prefer the restaurants in Stockholm. Here
      in Jönköping there is a huge amount of pizzerias and kebab, which can be
      nice sometimes. The restauant Bastard Burgers serve the best hamburgers in
      my opinion. On mondays the bar Shooters serve student tacos which is a
      nice tradition.
